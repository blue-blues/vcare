## 🎯 Project Overview

### Vision
Build a comprehensive, AI-powered hospital management system that automates and enhances every aspect of hospital operations while continuously learning and improving through machine learning.

### Core Objectives
- **Patient-Centric Care**: Streamline patient journey from registration to recovery
- **AI-Powered Decisions**: Leverage AI for diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and predictions
- **Operational Excellence**: Automate administrative tasks and optimize resource utilization
- **Continuous Learning**: Implement feedback loops for system improvement
- **Scalable Architecture**: Build for enterprise-scale with microservices

### Key Differentiators
1. **Full AI Integration**: Not just rule-based, but true ML/AI with predictive capabilities
2. **Real-time Processing**: Live updates across all modules
3. **Modular Architecture**: Each component can scale independently
4. **Learning Loop**: System improves with every interaction
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All hospital operations in one platform

## 🚀 Quick Start for Engineers
